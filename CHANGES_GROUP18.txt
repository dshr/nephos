Deviations:
- The red object navigation (using OpenCV) was originally supposed to control the clock view (i.e: circling a red circle to check 
  the 48 hours before or after the given time, instead of holding down the mouse). 
  However, as OpenCV was sorted very late, we were unable to fully implement this.
- There is no sound output at all since the actual implementation of libpd, the library that we were going to use for sound was left 
  until late and did not go the way we expected, giving strange undebuggable errors. The actual implementation of the library into the
  project got delayed because we spent most of out time designing the PureData patches for the application and thought it would be easy 
  to incoroporate libpd into Java based on out previous experience with it and iOS.
- Most of the sound and location tracking functionality is not working, but our user interface stuck very close to the prototype we had.
